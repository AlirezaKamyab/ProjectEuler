# ProjectEuler
![AlirezaKamyab](https://projecteuler.net/profile/AlirezaKamyab.png)

This repo contains codes which are solutions to projecteuler.net. These solutions are answers to problems < 100 to follow the policies fairly.
## About solutions
Solutions are proper and give the right answer. Like I said they are proper just because they give the right answer but not necessarily efficient either in time or memory. I tried my best to give my best solution. I also tried to explain some of the parts using comments which I mostly did not. Nevertheless I am happy to say that I tried to write as clean as possible even if they are not the right way to find the answer to the problem.

### Is there any other way?
I really like it if you can tell me if I did something wrong or there is any other way to find the solution
