# ProjectEuler
Answer to projectEuler.net 
These answers are not the best ones and some of them are not even efficient. I tried my best to make them efficient and clarify why I used what I used.
I tried to not to write down the answer it-self, so there is nothing to worry "projecteuler.net".
And FYI I am going to make this repo private before getting to problem 100
